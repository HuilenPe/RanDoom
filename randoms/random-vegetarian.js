      receta: "STEP 1: Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time – the sweeter the better).

STEP 3: Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil.

Let them sit for 10–15 minutes before trying to remove them from the pan. Let them cool before eating. Store in an airtight container at room temperature. They should last for several days.

Pulse until well combined but not pureed. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Use a 2-tablespoon scoop and your hands to form the mixture into 12 to 15 thick patties (be careful not to pack them too tight or your falafel will be dense). If they're not holding together, give the mixture a few more pulses in the food processor. Place the patties on the baking sheet. Drizzle generously with olive oil (this is the key to making these moist and crisp since we're not frying) and bake for 14 minutes. Flip and bake for 10 to 12 minutes more or until golden brown and crisp on the outside. During the last few minutes of baking, wrap the pita in foil and warm in the oven. Assemble pitas with a slather of hummus, diced veggies, falafel, herbs, pickled red onions, and generous drizzles of tahini sauce.",
